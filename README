README for 503-server
**********************

Updates and latest bugfixes at http://git.spheniscida.de/?p=503-server.git;a=summary

If you have to do some service on your webserver or have to keep it down because of security issues or attacks,
it's better to deliver a correct HTTP code and page instead of TCP RST the connection.

503-server is a little C++11 program using libsocket++ [1] written only for this purpose. To increase the performance, it
uses the libpthread-based C++11 threads to serve the connections.

Some stuff you should know to use this server:

* Use `make` in /src to build the program. The binary will be at /503srv. You'll need a C++11-compliant compiler (or at least C++0x).
* The server's threads wait by deafult 150 milliseconds before terminating to ensure that the content has been delivered. You may tune
this value.
* Of course, you may change the error message. But then you also have to change the value of the Content-Length HTTP field in the message!
* 503-server goes to background (daemon) immediately after starting up.
* 503-server logs to the file $PWD/503srv.log using a format like this:

Mon Jun 25 09:42:13 2012 Client: localhost:47696
Mon Jun 25 09:42:13 2012 Client: localhost:47697
Mon Jun 25 09:42:13 2012 Client: localhost:47698
Mon Jun 25 09:42:13 2012 Client: localhost:47699

To start the server, type the following:

$ ./503srv <PORT>

e.g.

# ./503srv 80
